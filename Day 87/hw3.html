        <p>Bruce McLaren made the team's Grand Prix debut at the 1966 Monaco race (of the current Formula One teams, only Ferrari is older[29][a]).[18] His race ended after <br>nine laps due to a terminal oil leak.[31] The 1966 car was the M2B designed by Robin Herd, but the programme was hampered by a poor choice of engines: a 3.0-litre version <br>of Ford's Indianapolis 500 engine and a Serenissima V8 were used, the latter scoring the team's first point in Britain, but both were underpowered and unreliable.[26][31] For 1967 Bruce decided to use a British Racing Motors (BRM) V12 engine, but due to delays with the <br>engine, was forced initially to use a modified Formula Two car called the M4B powered by a 2.1-litre BRM V8, later building a similar but slightly larger car called the M5A for the <br>V12.[31] Neither car brought great success, the best result being a fourth at Monaco.</p>
