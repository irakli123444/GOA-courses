        <h4>Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[18] The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports <br>car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.[19]

            In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[20][15] Musk co-led the third,<br> $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[21] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[21]
            
            In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO.[22] Eberhard then took the title of "President of Technology" before ultimately leaving <br>the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008.[23] In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and president.[24] Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008.[24] In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.[25] The case was dismissed in August 2009.[26]
            
            Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former Chevrolet dealership in Menlo Park.[27][28] By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and <br>delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his money to the company.[29]
            
            In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology <br>Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[30] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest.[31][32]
