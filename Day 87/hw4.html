        <p>Lamborghini was founded by Ferruccio Lamborghini in 1963. Ferruccio was an Italian entrepreneur, born in 1916, who initially made his fortune by manufacturing tractors under the name <br>Lamborghini Trattori after World War II. His tractors became popular for their high quality, and he expanded his business into other areas, including air conditioning and heating systems.

            However, Ferruccio was also passionate about cars, and he owned several high-performance vehicles, including models from Ferrari, a brand he greatly admired. But after some negative <br>experiences with Ferrari's customer service and quality control, he famously had a disagreement with Enzo Ferrari (the founder of Ferrari).
            
            Lamborghini was frustrated with the fact that the clutch in his Ferrari was often slipping, so he took his car to Ferrari's factory to suggest improvements. Ferrari reportedly dismissed <br>him, saying that a tractor maker should stick to making tractors and not complain about sports cars. This encounter motivated Ferruccio to prove that he could build a better sports car.
